## Happy Thanksgiving 2020!!

Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃🍁🍽 Hope you all have a <div>ine little holiday! 🧡 I’m grateful for the chance to learn to code & for all the beautiful friends along the way.💻➡️ The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS. - MDN
