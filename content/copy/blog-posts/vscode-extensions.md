## Prettier is a helpful Visual Studio Code extension that helps your code look, well “prettier.” 😂 “It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.” 

> As a new developer, I really like it for the wrap utility so I can easily see all the code within the vscode window. 👍🏽
